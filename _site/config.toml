abstract = """
Existing sketch generation models rely on hand-crafted stroke representations that are not very generalizable across datasets or drawing styles, and train multiple models to generate sketches over different object classes.
These issues make it challenging to embed deeper semantic knowledge of sketches or scale to a variety of classes.
Furthermore, the temporal and structural information present in human-drawn sketches is frequently lost by conventional raster-based methods.
We present a new system for conditional sketch generation and completion that uses a novel quantization and tokenization technique before encoding sketches into discrete token sequences.
To improve data quality, we use Ramer-Douglas-Peucker (RDP) and Bezier curve fitting to reconstruct smoother strokes.
We train a lightweight transformer model with an added class embedding layer to learn from multiple sketch object classes at once. This allows a single model to generalize across classes while reusing high-level shape priors.
